# Matrix_Inversion
A python program to calculate the inverse of NxN matrix, illustrating the use of data structures and recursion. A top down approach has been adopted to solve the problem of finding an inverse and each function can be used independently to solve the respective problem such as finding the determinant, finding the co-factor matrix or finding the transpose of a matrix.
